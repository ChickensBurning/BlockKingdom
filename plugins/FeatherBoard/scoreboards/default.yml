# Default FeatherBoard comes with a board called "default". All players have the permission
# featherboard.group.default  (by default) meaning all players should see the scoreboard unless
# the permission is negated.

# Example of the use of settings
# This section is optional
settings:
  # The priority of the scoreboard. The higher the number -> higher priority
  # Used when having more than one scoreboard assigned
  priority: 10

# This section is required. Those are your scoreboard lines
lines:
  # Every section here are different lines. The first section will be used as the title
  # the following sections will be used as the lines on the scoreboard (max 15)
  # Just as the scoreboard names you can name these 'lines' whatever you want. But to make
  # things simple I will use logical names such as "title", "spacer", "header", ...
  title:
    # Every line has its own frames. The animation will loop through these frames on intervals
    # that you configure below.
    # Put all your frames under 'text:'. You can make as many lines as you want and use
    # placeholders and preset effects.
    # Keep in mind that there is a limit in line width!
    frames:
    # To create cool looking animations you create yourself
    # you can use the graphical tool AnimationCreator
    # https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/animationcreator.6001/
    # For all placeholders:   https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/mvdw-placeholders/
    # For all preset effects: https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/mvdw-effects/
    - '<glow glowsize="5" startglowcolor="&3&l" glowcolor="&b&l" endglowcolor="&3&l" normalcolor="&2&l">BlockKingdom    </glow>'
    # Interval is the animation interval in TICKS (20 ticks is one second).
    # Every X ticks the animation goes to the next frame (see above)
    # Once all frames are finished it will start over from the first one
    interval: 5
    # If you don't want a static order of the frames and want to show each frame at random
    # you can enable this option.
    random: false
  # A scoreboard is dynamic. The lines can change length due to smaller placeholders or scrolling text.
  # that is why it is advised to have something on your scoreboard that is bigger then all other lines.
  # These lines (usually a header or footer) are also good for decoration.
